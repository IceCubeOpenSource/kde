Installation Instructions
-------------------------
Download the software into directory <DIR>. There should be a subdirectory
named "kde" within the <DIR> directory.

To install in a location independent of your system Python files, install via
the following command:

$ pip install <DIR>[cuda] --user

where [cuda] is optional, ensuring support for GPU.

To install with references to the source code where it is downloaded (so that
changes in the sourcecode are reflected immediately):

$ pip install -e <DIR>[cuda] --user
